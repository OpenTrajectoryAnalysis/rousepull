    "# Predicting locus release\n",
    "Instead of pulling a locus with a defined force and observing the resulting trajectory (as in our original publication), one might conceive an experiment displaying a \"zero-susceptibility pull\"; i.e. a strong object following a predefined path and pulling the locus with it, regardless of the force necessary to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a fictional example, consider pulling literally \"by hand\", i.e. using tweezers: the pN forces exerted by the locus would do nothing to change the path taken by the tweezers, since the origin of the pulling force (your hand) overcomes these forces with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a scenario like this, pulls are defined by the taken trajectory, instead of the applied force. As such, as long as locus stays attached to the pulling object, the trajectory follows the predefined path and thus does not convey much interesting information. The relevant part of the experiment is then the release/detachment and subsequent recoil of the locus.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the pull, the polymer gets stretched and thus starts generating a restoring force. Upon release, this force is free to act on the locus and thus pulls it back; the question is now whether the recoil follows the expected behavior, given the trajectory during the pull. While this is the case exactly if the inferred force during the recoil is zero, it might be useful for visualization to actually plot this expected recoil. This is demonstrated in this example."

To predict the recoil, we thus simply calculate the trajectory belonging to the force profile that matches the inferred force during the pull and then drops to zero. As expected, we obtain a trajectory that reproduces exactly the observed one during the pull (where the forces also match), but then shows a different recoil behavior.\n",
