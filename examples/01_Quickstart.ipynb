    " - the inferred force is negative, since this is the restoring force exerted by the polymer on the locus.\n",
    " - the plot shows how the inference works with the discretization inherent to the data: the force is assumed to be constant between measurements, and identically equal to zero before the first one.\n",

    "## Calibration\n",
    "To make the force inference quantitative, we need to calibrate the conversion factor between time and length scales (note that above we wrote `x(t) = √t`, which of course does not make sense in physical units). To that end, we use the MSD prefactor from the force free situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the absence of pulling force, the locus under consideration should undergo Rouse diffusion, i.e. exhibit an MSD `⟨x²(t)⟩ = Γ√t`. We can use this prefactor `Γ` to calibrate the inference; it is simply passed as parameter to the constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, let's assume that the lag time between successive frames is 10s, and the locus moves with Γ = 0.003 μm²/√s in the absence of force, while the measured displacement `x(t)` is in μm already. The inference then gives the force profile in pN:"

    "In the [original publication](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abi9810) we inserted additional hindrance to the locus motion due to dragging surrounding material. This can work in a few different ways, for this example let us assume that some of the chromatin the locus moves through sticks to it. This generates an additional force component, that can be calculated using the `computeFdrag()` function."
